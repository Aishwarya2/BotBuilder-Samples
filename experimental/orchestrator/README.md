# Orchestrator (PREVIEW)

Orchestrator is [transformer][4] based technology that is heavily optimized for conversational AI applications. Orchestrator is built ground-up to run locally with your bot with no additional service calls required.

Conversational AI applications today are built using disparate technologies to fulfill language understanding (LU) needs â€“ e.g. [LUIS][1], [QnA Maker][2]. Often, conversational AI applications are also built by assembling different [skills][3] each of which fulfill a specific conversation topic and can be built using different LU technologies. Hence, conversational AI applications typically require LU arbitration/ decision making to route incoming user request to an appropriate skill or to dispatch to a specific sub-component. Orchestration refers to the ability to perform LU arbitration/ decision making for a conversational AI application.  


## Supported scenarios
1. **Dispatch**: Orchestrator is a successor to [dispatch][5]. You can use Orchestrator instead of the current [dispatch][5] solution to arbitrate across your [LUIS][1] and [QnA Maker][2] applications. With Orchestrator, you are likely to see  
- improved classification accuracy
- higher resilience to data imbalance across your LUIS and QnA Maker authoring data.
- ability to correctly dispatch from relatively little authoring data.
2. **Recognizer**: You can use Orchestrator as a recognizer with [Adaptive dialogs][6]. 

## Authoring experience

Here's the end to end authoring experience.

Using [BF CLI][7]

1. [Export your LUIS application][8] and [convert to .lu format][9] or [export your QnA Maker KB to .qna format][10] 
2. Use `bf orchestrator:nlr:get` to download the NLR model.
3. Use `bf orchestrator:create` or `bf orchestrator:build` to generate the snapshot content.
